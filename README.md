# 🚀 Yo! I'm Aryan — Code Bender | Game Cook | Logic Wizard 🎮⚙️

Welcome to my world of caffeine-fueled coding, memory leaks (just kidding… kinda), and late-night “just one more bug fix” sessions.  
I’m 17, dangerously curious, and on a mission to turn code into magic. 🪄

## 🧠 What I Do (and Love Doing)

- 🔧 Write **clean, efficient C/C++** like it’s my second language (because it kinda is)
- 🧱 Build data structures from scratch just for the thrill of it
- 🧠 Tinker with **machine learning**, especially **feature selection**
- 🎮 Code games in **C++ using SFML**, where logic meets chaos in the best way possible
- 🤓 Respect the power of **OOP**, **algorithms**, and that one semicolon that breaks everything

## 🎯 Projects That Actually Slap

### 🎮 **2D RPG Game in SFML**
> Your classic pixel brawler with enemies, player stats, save/load system, and an OOP engine under the hood.

### 🔍 **Feature SelectX (Python ML Tool)**
> A machine learning sidekick that helps pick the best features with cool visualizations and comparison charts.

### 🧰 **dstructs: Custom C Data Structures Library**
> Built my own stack, queue, linked list, tree, and hash map just to flex my pointers. Modular, documented, ready to use.

### ♟️ **Unbeatable Game AI**
> Minimax + Alpha Beta + SFML frontend = A bot that’ll humble your Tic Tac Toe ego and Connect 4 dreams.

## 🧠 Current Experiments

- 🤖 Training game enemies to **learn** from player behavior
- 🧩 Breaking down **design patterns** into C++ demos
- 🌐 Crafting a slick **portfolio site** (with a hint of game vibes)
